# 🏥 Project Title

***🏥 Healthcare Appointment No-Show Analysis***

## 📖 Project Overview

Missed medical appointments are a significant challenge for healthcare systems, leading to wasted resources, increased costs, and delayed treatments.

This project analyzes a dataset of **110,000+ hospital appointments in Brazil** to explore the factors that influence whether patients show up for their scheduled appointments.

By examining demographics, health conditions, communication methods, geography, and scheduling factors, this analysis aims to uncover actionable insights that can help hospitals reduce no-shows and improve patient care.

## ❓ Problem Statements

#### 1. Overall Trends

What percentage of patients miss their appointments?

#### 2. Demographics

Does age affect the likelihood of a no-show?

Are males or females more likely to miss appointments?

#### 3. Health Conditions

Do patients with hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, or disabilities have higher or lower no-show rates?

#### 4. Communication

Do SMS reminders reduce the probability of a no-show?

#### 5. Geography

Are some neighbourhoods more prone to no-shows than others?

#### 6. Scheduling Factors

Does the waiting time (days between scheduling and appointment) influence no-shows?

#### 7. Socioeconomic Factors

Do patients on the scholarship program (social welfare) show different attendance patterns?
